Translation Notes/ Dagiti Nota para iti pangbalikas:

    garden/xxxxxx - A special collection of trees and plants that God prepared for Adam and Eve to enjoy and from which to eat. This should be the same word that was used in [01-11]. See how you translated it there./Sabsabali a naurnong a kakayo ken mulmula nga insagana ti Dios para kenni Adan ken Eve a pagragsakan ken pangalaan ti kanen da.
    talked with God/nakitungtung ti Dios - The word for “talk” should be the same as would be used to refer to talking to a human being. God may have taken a physical form to talk to the man and the woman since the text indicates that they talked to him face-to-face.Ti sao a "tungtung" ket parehas iti 
    shame - The feeling that comes with knowing we have sinned or that we fall short in some way.
