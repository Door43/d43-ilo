\v 43 \add By buying land you, Jeremiah, have predicted that some day\add* people will buy and sell fields in this land about which you people of Jerusalem now say, "The Babylonian soldiers have destroyed it. It is now desolate. It is a land where there are no longer any people or animals."
\v 44 \add But some day\add* people will again buy and sell fields here. People will sign documents \add about buying those fields\add*, and other people will witness them doing that. That will happen in the land where \add the descendants of\add* Benjamin live and here in the villages near Jerusalem, in other towns in Judah, in the hilly areas and in the foothills \add to the west\add*, and in the southern desert area, too. Some day I will cause them to prosper again. \add That will surely happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.'~"

\v 43 Then fields will be bought in this land, about which you are saying, 'This is a ruined land, which has neither man nor beast. It has been given over into the hand of the Chaldeans.'
\v 44 They will buy fields with silver and write in sealed scrolls. They will assemble witnesses in the land of Benjamin, all around Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, 
in the cities in the hill country and in the lowlands, and in the cities of the Negev. For I will bring back their fortunes"—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
