<usfm>
\v 16 if he does not oppress anyone, seize a pledge, or takes stolen things, but instead gives his food to the hungry and covers the naked with clothes—
\v 17 if he draws his hand back from judging the poor and does not take interest or unjust profit; if he carries out my decrees and walks according 
to my statutes, then he will not die for his father’s sin. He will certainly live!
