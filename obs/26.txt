Kalpasan nga nagballigi ni Hesus iti panangsulisog ni satanas, nagsubli iti region nga galilia a pagnanaedanna babaen iti pannakabalin ti nasantuan nga Ispiritu . Ket napan ti naduma-duma a lugar nga agisuro. Sagtunggal maysa ket ibagbagada nga nasayaat isuna.

Napan ni Hesus iti ili nga Nasaret nga isu ti nagnaedanna iti kina ubingna. Ti aldaw ti panaginana, napan isuna idiay lugar a pagdaydayawan. Ket intedda kanyana ti libro ni propeta isaias tapnon basaenna ti nakalanad sadiay. Ni Hesus linuktanna ti libro ket binasa daytoy kadagiti tattao.

Binasa ni Hesus, "ti Dios inted na kanyak ti Ispirituna tapno maipadamag ko ti naimbag a damag kadagiti managrigrigat, pannakawayawaya dagiti na nabalud, panagsubli ti panagkita dagiti bulsek, ken pannakawayawaya dagiti naibalod. Daytoy ti tawen ti pabor ti Apo."

Ket nagtugaw ni Hesus ket aminda ket kumitkita kenkuana. Ammo da adiay paset nga nabasa ket maipapan iti Mesias. Kinuna ni Hesus, "ti sao nga innak imbasa kadakayo ket mapaspasamaken itatta." Nasda-aw amin nga tattao. "saan kadi nga daytoy ti anak ni Jose?" kinunada.

Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown. When the prophet Elijah was alive there were many widows in Israel. But when it did not rain for three and a half years, God did not send Elijah to help a widow from Israel but a widow from a different nation.”

“And when the prophet Elisha was alive, there were many people in Israel with skin diseases. But Elisha did not heal any of them, he only healed Naaman, a commander of Israel’s enemies.” When the people heard this, they were furious.

They dragged Jesus out of the place of worship and brought him to the edge of a cliff to throw him off. But Jesus walked through the crowd and left the town of Nazareth.

Then Jesus went through that area, and great crowds came to him. They brought all the sick people, including those who could not see, walk, hear, or speak, and Jesus healed them.

Many people with demons were brought to Jesus. The demons came out, often shouting, “You are the Son of God!” The crowds were amazed and worshiped God.

Then Jesus chose twelve men who were called his disciples. The disciples were Jesus’ students. They traveled with him and learned from him.
