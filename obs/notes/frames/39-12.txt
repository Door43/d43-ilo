===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **riot** - That is, "start doing violent things in their anger."
  * **he agreed to have** - Pilate did not want to kill Jesus because he believed that Jesus was innocent. But he was forced to tell his soldiers to crucify Jesus because of his fear of the crowd. If possible, translate this phrase in a way that shows his reluctance.
  * **a royal robe** - That is, "a robe like a king's robe." This robe had a bright color, so it looked like the kind of robe that a king would wear.
  * **crown made of thorns** - This means that they tied thorn branches into a circle to look like a crown. A crown is an ornament that a king wears on his head to show his authority. But the crown that they put on Jesus' head had sharp, dangerous thorns on it.
  * **Look** - That is, "Look at" or, "Here is."
  * **the King of the Jews** - Since the soldiers were mocking Jesus, this could be translated as, "the so-called King of the Jews."
  * //A Bible story from//  - These references may be slightly different in some Bible translations.
