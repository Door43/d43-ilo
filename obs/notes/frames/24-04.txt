  * **See** - This could be translated as "Look and see" or, "Pay attention!"
  * **my messenger** - That is, "I, Yahweh, will send my messenger." In some languages it would be more natural to use an indirect quote for this sentence, such as: "what the prophet Isaiah predicted when he said that God would send his messenger."
  * **ahead of you** - In this phrase, the word "you" refers to the Messiah.
  * **prepare your way** - God's messenger will prepare the people to listen to the Messiah.
