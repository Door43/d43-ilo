==== Translation Notes: ====

  *

**fruit**  - We don't know what kind of fruit this was. We only know that it grew on this tree. If possible it is best to use a general word for fruit here, and not a word for a specific kind of fruit.

  *

**tree of the knowledge of good and evil**  - The woman correctly understood that they were not allowed to eat from this one tree that would enable them to understand evil as well as good.

  *

**you will die**  - Use your ordinary word for death, for a person's physical life to end. Don't avoid the term just because the thought of death sounds too harsh. **[[https://door43.org/ilo/obs/notes/frames/02-02|<<]] | [[https://door43.org/ilo/obs/notes/02|Up]] | [[https://door43.org/ilo/obs/notes/frames/02-04|>>]]**
