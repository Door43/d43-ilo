  * **was afraid and did not want to go**  - Moses knew that Pharaoh wanted to kill him, and he did not believe that he could do what God wanted him to do.
  * **Moses' brother, Aaron**  - Aaron was Moses's actual brother from his Israelite mother and father. Aaron would have been at least several years older than Moses.
  * **stubborn**  - This means the Pharaoh would refuse to obey God. You may also want to add, "stubborn and refuse to listen (or obey)."
