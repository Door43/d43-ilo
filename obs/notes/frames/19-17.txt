Most of the time, the people did not **obey God**. They often mistreated the **prophets** and sometimes even killed them. Once, the prophet **Jeremiah** was put into a **dry well** and left there to die. He sank down into the mud that was in the bottom of the well, but then the **king had mercy on him** and ordered his servants to pull Jeremiah out of the well before he died.
