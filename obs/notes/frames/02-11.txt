Ket matay ka ken agsubli ti bagim iti abo. Pinanagana ti lalaki ti asawa na ti Eve. Ti kayat na saoen ket “mannangted ti biag” gapu ta agbalin isuna nga Inang iti amin a tattao. Santo binaduan ti Dios ni Adam ken Eve babaen iti kudil ti ayup.

  * **mother of all people** - This means that she would be the female ancestor of all people. Some languages say "she would be the grandmother of all people."
