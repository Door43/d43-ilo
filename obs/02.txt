====== 2. Sin Enters the World ======


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-01.jpg}}


Adam and his wife were very happy living in the beautiful garden God had made for them. Neither of them wore clothes, but they did not feel any shame, because there was no sin in the world. They often walked in the garden and talked with God.


Mayat ti biag ti lalaki ken ti babai iti kakaykaywan. Sadiay, amin nga kasapulanda ket adda. Ngem ngagbaliw dayta gapu iti maysa nga pasamak.

But there was a crafty snake in the garden. He asked the woman, “Did God really tell you not to eat the fruit from the trees in the garden?”


Ti uleg nga kasikapan iti amin nga pinarsua ti Dios nga animal, ket kinunana ket babai iti maysa nga aldaw, "Apay agpayso nga madiyo mabalin nga kanen dagiti bunga ti kaykayo ditoy nga kakaykaywan?"

The woman answered, “God told us we could eat the fruit of any tree except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told us, ‘If you eat that fruit or even touch it, you will die.’”


"Apay agpayso nga madiyo mabalin nga kanen dagiti bunga ti kaykayo ditoy nga kakaykaywan?" 
"Saan", kuna ti babai. 
"Diay laeng bunga diay adda idiay tennga ti madimi mabilin nga kanen ta nu aramidenmi kanu dayta wenno uray sagidenmi laeng dayta ket mataykami."

The snake responded, “That is not true! You won’t die. God just knows that as soon as you eat it, you will understand things like He does. You will be like God, knowing good and evil.”


"Saan agpayso dayta!" Kuna ti uleg. "Saan kayo nga matay! Agbalinkayo ket di a nga kasla iti Dios. Maamoanyo ti naimbag ken ti dakes nu mangankayo iti dayta nga bunga."

The woman saw that the fruit was beautiful and looked delicious. She also wanted to be wise, so she picked some of the fruit and ate it. Then she turned and gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.


Nakita ti babai nga kasla naimas ti bunga nasulisog isuna ket nagpuros iti kinanna. Inikanna met ti kanenna diay lalaki.

Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they realized they were naked. They tried to cover their nakedness by sewing leaves together to make clothes.


Idi nakapangandan, naamirisda nga awan ti kawesda ket nagbainda.

Then the man and his wife heard the sound of God walking through the garden. They both hid from God. Then God called to the man, “Where are you?” Adam replied, “I heard you walking in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid.”

Iti sumungad ti Dios ket kinunana, "Lalaki ti sadino ti ayanmo? Aglemlemmengak ta awan ti kawesko", kuna ti lalaki. 
"Nangegko nga sumungadka ket nagbutengak."

Then God asked, “Who told you that you were naked? Did you eat the fruit I told you not to eat?” The man answered, “You gave me this woman, and she gave me the fruit.” Then God asked the woman, “What have you done?” The woman replied, “The snake tricked me.”


"Kinanmo kadi ti bunga ti kayo nga iparparit nga kanem?" kuna ti Dios. 
"Wen", kuna met ti lalaki. "Inikanak met ngamin ti kanek ti babai nga intedmo nga mangkadkadua kaniak!" 
"Apay nga inaramidmo dayta?" Kinuna ti Dios iti babai. Inallilawnak met ngamin ti uleg." Kinunana met.

God said to the snake, “You are cursed! You will slide on your belly and eat dirt. You and the woman will hate each other, and your children and her children will hate each other, too. The woman’s descendant will crush your head, and you will wound his heel.”

Gapu iti dayta inulud ti Dios ti uleg. 


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-10.jpg}}


God then said to the woman, “I will make childbirth very painful for you. You will desire your husband, and he will rule over you.”


Dinusana met ti babai ken ti lalaki. Kunana, "Babai, adadunto ti rigatmo iti panaganakmo. Iturayannaka ti lalaki."


{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-02-11.jpg}}


God said to the man, “You listened to your wife and disobeyed me. Now the ground is cursed, and you will need to work hard to grow food. Then you will die, and your body will return to dirt.” The man named his wife Eve, which means “life,” because she would become the mother of all people. And God clothed Adam and Eve with animal skins.


"Lalaki, ilunudko ti daga nga tartarabahoem. Marigatan kanto nga mangtrabaho daytoy ket agrigatka nga agbirok ti pagbiagmo. Nu matayka, agsublika iti daga nga naggapuam."

Then God said, “Now that the human beings have become like us by knowing good and evil, they must not be allowed to eat the fruit of the tree of life and live forever.” So God sent Adam and Eve away from the beautiful garden. God placed large, powerful angels at the entrance to the garden to keep anyone from eating the fruit of the tree of life.


Kinuna ti Dios iti bagina, "Ita ta nakapananen ti lalaki ken ti babai ti bunga ti kayo ti pannakaammo. Masapul nga saandan nga matulokan nga mangan iti bunga ti kayo ti biag, tapno saandan nga maadaan ti biag nga awan patengana." Pinapanawna ngarud ida idiay kakaykaywan ket nangipan iti mangbantay iti dalan nga mapan iti kayo iti biag.
