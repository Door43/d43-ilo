This is how the beginning of everything happened. God created the universe and everything in it in six days. At first, the earth was dark and empty, and nothing had been formed in it. But God's Spirit was there over the water.

Kastoy ti pangrugian ti amin.Ti umuna nga inaramid ti Dios ket ti lubong.Ngem ti dayta nga panawen, awan pay ti anniayaman nga makita ti lubong gapu ta puro nga danum ken sipngit. Ngem Espirito ti Dios, addan iti lubong.

Then God spoke and said, "Let there be light!" And there was light. God saw that the light was good and called it "day." He separated it from the darkness, which He called "night." God created the light on the first day of creation.

Tatta, kinuna ti Dios, "Adda ti lawag." Isu nga naglawag. Idi makita ti Dios iti inaramidna, naayatan isuna.

On the second day of creation, God spoke and created the sky above the earth.

On the third day, God spoke and separated the water from the dry land. He called the dry land "earth," and He called the water "seas."

Then God said, "Let the earth produce all kinds of trees and plants." And that is what happened. God saw that what He had created was good, and He was pleased with it all.

On the fourth day of creation, God spoke and made the sun, the moon, and the stars. God made them to give light to the earth and to mark day and night, seasons and years.

On the fifth day, God created everything that swims in the water and all the birds. God saw that it was good, and He blessed them.

On the sixth day of creation, God said, "Let there be all kinds of land animals!" And it happened just like God said. Some were farm animals, some crawled on the ground, and some were wild. And God saw that it was good.

Then God said, "Let us make human beings in our image to be like us. They will have authority over the earth and all the animals."

So God took some dirt, formed it into a man, and breathed life into him. This man's name was Adam. God planted a garden where Adam could live, and put him there to care for it.

Kastoy ti pinangparswa ti Dios iti tao: Nangala iti daga, pinormana daytoy, sana inpukaw ti anges iti biag iti daytoy. ket naaddaan ngarud ti biag ti tao. Impan ti Dios ti lalaki iti kakaykaywan.

In the middle of the garden, God planted two special treesâ€”the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God told Adam that he could eat from any tree in the garden except from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If he ate from this tree, he would die.

iti tenga datya nga lugar ket ti kayo iti biag ken ti kayo ti panakaammo iti naimbag ken ti dakes. kuna ti Dios iti lalaki, "Mabalinmo nga kanen dagiti bunga ti amin nga kaykayo dayta," "malaksid laeng ti bunga ti panakaammo ti naimbag ken ti dakes." "ta nu aramiden dayta matayka."

Then God said, "It is not good for man to be alone." But none of the animals could be Adam's helper.

Kalpasan dayta, kuna ti Dios iti bagina, "Saan nga nasayaat nu agmaymaysa ti lalaki" "masapul nga adda mangkadkadua kenkuana." Ngem pulos nga awan kadagiti pinarsua ti Dios ti maiannatup nga mangkadua iti lalaki.

So God made Adam fall into a deep sleep. Then God took one of Adam's ribs and made it into a woman and brought her to him.

Pinaturog ngarud ti Dios ti lalaki. ket nangala iti paragpagna ket inaramidna daytoy nga babai. Intedna ti babai iti lalaki.

{{https://api.unfoldingword.org/obs/jpg/1/en/360px/obs-en-01-14.jpg?direct&}}

When Adam saw her, he said, "At last! This one is like me! Let her be called 'Woman,' for she was made from Man." This is why a man leaves his father and mother and becomes one with his wife.

ket kuna ti lalaki nga, "Daytoy ti kamaiatan nga kaduak" "Isu ti kapadpadak!" Nagbiag ngarud ti lalaki ken ti babai iti kakaykaywan. Agpada nga awan ti kawesda ngem awan ti panagbain kadakuada.

God made man and woman in His own image, and He saw that it was very good. He blessed them and told them, "Have many children and grandchildren and fill the earth!" This all happened on the sixth day of creation.

When the seventh day came, God had already finished His work. So God rested from all He had been doing. He blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on this day He rested from His work. This is how God created the universe and everything in it.

Nakita ti Dios nga amin nga inaramidna ket nasayaat ket naragsaken ngarud isuna.
