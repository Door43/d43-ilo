  * David's son Solomon built the first templeon Mount Moriah in Jerusalem.
  * The Babylonians destroyed Jerusalem, but 70 years later God allowed them to return and rebuild the city.
  * Because the temple was located there, Jerusalem was the center for celebrating the major Jewish festivals.
  * In the New Testament, Jesus was dedicated as a baby at the temple in Jerusalem and it was in Jerusalem where he was put on trial and sentenced to die on a cross.
  * After Jesus came back to life, Jerusalem was one of the main places where Jesus spent time with his disciples before he returned to heaven.
  * Since Jerusalem was located in the mountains of Israel, people normally referred to going to Jerusalem as "going up to Jerusalem."
