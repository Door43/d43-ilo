===== Facts: =====

God told Moses many commands that He wanted the Israelites to obey. He wrote ten of these commands on two slabs of stone.

  * These Ten Commandments were special commands to help the Israelites love and worship God and love other people.
  * These commandments were also part of God's covenant with his people. By obeying what God had commanded them to do, the people of Israel would show that they loved God and belonged to him.
