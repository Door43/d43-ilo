====== anak a lalaki ======

===== Kaipapanan: =====

Ti "anak a lalaki" mabalin nga ampon wenno pudno nga anak.

  * Ti "anak ni" ket inaramat iti Bibliya nga mangibaga nu siasino ti tao a pagtutungtungan. Kaspangarigan, idjay 1 Kings 4 ni, "Azariah, anak ni Zadok" ket duma kenni "Azariah, nga anak ni Nathan." Dagitoy nga dua ket duma kenni "Azariah, nga anak ni Amaziah" nga masarakan idjay 2 Kings 15. Dagitoy ket maipada iti tiempo tayo tatta nu maipapan ti apilyedo tapno maibaga ti nagdumaan da aglalo nu agpada ti nagan da.
  * Mabalin nga usaren dagitoy nu awagan ti lalaki nga ub-ubing.
  * Ti Baro a Tulag dagiti namati kenni Kristo ket maawagan nga "Annak ti Dios."

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * In most occurrences of this term, it is best to translate "son" using the literal term in the language that is used to refer to a son.
  * When translating the term "Son of God," the usual, common term for "son" should be used.
  * When used to refer to a descendant rather than a direct son, the term "descendant" could be used, as in referring to Jesus as the "descendant of David" or in genealogies where sometimes "son" refers to a male descendant.
  * Sometimes "sons" can be translated as "children" when both males and females are being referred to. For example, "sons of God" could be translated as "children of God" since this expression also includes girls and women.
  * The figurative expression "son of" can be translated as "someone who has the characteristics of" or "someone who is like" or "someone who has" or "someone who acts like."
