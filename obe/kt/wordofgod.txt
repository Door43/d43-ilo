====== Sao ti Dios, sao ni Yahweh, sao ti Apo, nasantuan a surat ======

===== Definition: =====

The term "word of God" refers to anything that God has communicated to people. This includes spoken and written messages.

  * Many years after God's words were written down, people can still read these scriptures and know God's teachings.
  * The term "scriptures" refers specifically to the written message that God told people to write.
  * The related terms "word of Yahweh" and "word of the Lord" often refer to a specific message from God that was given to a prophet or other person in the Bible.
  * Sometimes this occurs as simply "the word" or "my word" or "your word" (when talking about God's word).
  * In the New Testament, Jesus is called "the Word" and "the Word of God." These titles mean that Jesus fully reveals who God is, because he is God himself.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * Depending on the context, other ways to translate this term could include, "the message of Yahweh" or "God's message" or "the teachings from God."
  * It may be more natural in some languages to make this term plural and say "God's words" or "the words of Yahweh."
  * The expression "the word of God (or Yahweh) came" is often used to introduce something that God told his prophet or his people. This could be translated as, "Yahweh spoke these words" or "God spoke this message."
  * The term "scripture" or "scriptures" could be translated as "the writings" or "the written message from God." This term should be translated differently from the translation of the term "word."
  * When "word" occurs alone, it could be translated as "message" or "God's word" or "teachings," depending on the context. Also consider the alternate translations suggested above.
