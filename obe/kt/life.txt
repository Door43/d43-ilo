===== Definition: =====

These terms are used in the Bible to talk about "physical life" and "spiritual life."

=== 1. Physical life ===

  * Physical life is the presence of the spirit in the body. God breathed life into Adam's body, and he became a living being.
  * A "life" can also refer to an individual person, as in, "a life was saved".
  * Sometimes the word "life" refers to the experience of living, as in, "They made their lives bitter."
  * It can also refer to a person's lifespan as in the expression, "the end of his life."
  * The term "living" may refer to being physically alive as in, "my mother is still living." It may also refer to dwelling somewhere as in, "they were living in the city."
  * The opposite of "life" is "death." These two concepts are often contrasted in the Bible.

=== 2. Spiritual life ===

  * A person has spiritual life when he believes in Jesus and God gives that person a transformed life with the Holy Spirit living in him.
  * This life is also called "eternal life" to indicate that it does not end.
  * The opposite of spiritual life is spiritual death, which means being separated from God and experiencing eternal punishment.
