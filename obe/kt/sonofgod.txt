====== Son of God, the Son ======

===== Facts: =====

The Son of God is Jesus, who came into the world as a human being to save and rule the world.

  * The Son of God has the same nature as God the Father, and is therefore fully God.
  * God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are all of one essence.
  * Unlike human sons, the Son of God has always existed.
  * In the beginning, the Son of God was active in creating the world, along with the Father and the Holy Spirit.
  * Because Jesus is God's Son, he loves and obeys his Father, and his Father loves him.

===== Translation Suggestions: =====

  * For the term, "Son of God," it is best to translate "Son" with the same word the language would naturally use to refer to a "son" of a human father.
  * Make sure the word used to translate "son" fits with the word used to translate "father" and that these words are the most natural ones to express a true father-son relationship.
