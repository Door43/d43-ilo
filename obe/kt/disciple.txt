===== Definition: =====

The term "disciple" refers to a person who follows a teacher and learns from him.

  * The people who followed Jesus around, listening to his teachings and obeying them, were called his "disciples." John the Baptist also had disciples.
  * At different times during Jesus' ministry, there were many disciples who followed him and heard his teachings.
  * From among the many disciples who followed Jesus, he chose twelve to be his closest followers; these men became known as his "apostles." Jesus' twelve apostles continued to also be called "disciples."
  * Just before Jesus went up to heaven, he commanded his disciples to teach other people about him so that those people could become his disciples, too.
  * In modern times as well, anyone who believes in Jesus and obeys his teachings is also called a disciple of Jesus.
